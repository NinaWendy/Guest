# Guestbook
Guestbook is a simple web application that is built and deployed with Docker and Kubernetes. The application consists of a web front end which has a text input where you can enter any text and submit. For all of these I created a Kubernetes Deployments and Pods. Then applied Horizontal Pod Scaling to the Guestbook application and finally worked on Rolling Updates and Rollbacks.
